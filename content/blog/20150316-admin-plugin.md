title: Admin Plugin Now Available
----
With the release of Baun v1.3.1 comes our first premium plugin, the [Baun Admin Plugin](/plugins/admin). The Admin
plugin for Baun gives you a familiar web-based editor for managing your content. You can login and edit pages &amp; posts
from anywhere in the world, just like you would with any other CMS backend.

The Baun Admin Plugin is great for those folks who have restricted or slow access to their server, or
for developers who want to allow their clients to edit their site without messing about with text editors and FTP access.
